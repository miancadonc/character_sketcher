# # Character Sketcher

This simple web app allows the user to create and delete character sketches for various environments. The user can, on a single page, create a list of different novels, DnD campaigns, writing projects, shows, etc., as well as create short descriptions of important characters in each of those various environments.


## Getting Started

Fork and clone from github.com/miancadonc/character_sketcher. In the terminal, navigate to the rails directory of this project, which is in the backend directory. Run `rails db:migrate` to create the database tables in your development database. Then, start up the rails server in that same directory, and navigate back to the top level project directory to open index.html in your default browser by running `open index.html`

### Prerequisites

There are several gems listed in the gemfile. Running `bundle install` in the terminal should install everything necessary to run the app if you don't have them already.

### Installing

As stated above, fork and clone the repository from github.com/miancadonc/dinner_decider, then bundle install run the migrations. The app should now be functional.

## Acknowledgments

The program at Flatiron provided me a huge amount of examples of rails and javascript projects and the community offered its support during the creation of this app. In particular, I'd like to thank Tao Liu for patiently helping me find the blind spots and pushing me to figure out my own solution.
