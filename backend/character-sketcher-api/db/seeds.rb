# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# char_1 = Character.create(name: "Gon", age: "12", gender: "Male", description: "Black spiky shounen protag hair, green shorts and jacket, and a fishing pole.", goals: "Hang out with best friend Killua. Meet dad Ging.", backstory: "Grew up on whale island as a feral nature child and favorite of the townsfolk. His aunt raised him and he's never met his parents.")
# char_2 = Character.create(name: "Killua", age: "12", gender: "Male", description: "Little white haired cat boy with the best 'fits.", goals: "Hang out with best friend Gon. Maybe become his boyfriend. Unclear.", backstory: "His family is a famous group of assassins, and he's been trained (abused) since he was little.")
